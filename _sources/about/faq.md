The short answer is: by default, use `Dr.` + `<last name>` or `Professor` + `<last name>` unless a professor invites you to address them otherwise (as I will do).

```{dropdown} Do I need to buy anything for this course?

No, you do not need to purchase anything for this course. You will need access to a computer, and ideally, you will bring a computer with you to class. If you do not have a computer, please email me or come see me and I may be able to lend you a computer during class time. I will also try to make sure that the notebooks I create are compatible with the free google colaboratory (https://colab.research.google.com/), so you can work through the exercises from any computer connected to the internet.

```{dropdown} How can I contact the professor?

When questions arise, you can of course reach out to me for help. I can try to answer simple questions by email, but for most questions, we will want to schedule a meeting (in person, by phone, or by zoom). Email is just too inefficient for complex questions; typically we will need some back-and-forth, and we can usually cover more ground in 10 minutes of conversation than in a long email exchange.

```{dropdown} Will lectures be recorded so I can re-watch them to study?

For about half the classes, lectures will be pre-recorded and available on this website. I might record class sessions, but I cannot promise that yet.

```{dropdown} Is attendance mandatory?

- Attendance is **highly recommended**, but not required.
- That said, part of your grade is based on in-class participation; if you miss more than a couple of classes, that part of your grade will certainly decline
