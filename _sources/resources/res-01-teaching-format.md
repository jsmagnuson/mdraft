Course format
=======================

This course is going to use a mix of approaches, beginning with the meeting
format.

### Meeting format
We will use a hybrid meeting most weeks. This means you can
*always* attend by video link (which will either be zoom or teams), and most
weeks you can attend in person (in Arjona 307). I say *most* weeks because
there will be some weeks when I will be away, and the class will be online only
those weeks. *If this poses a problem for anyone, please let me know.*

### Flipped lectures

For several meetings this semester, I will post mini-lectures online. Please
review the syllabus and materials for the upcoming week well in advance, and
watch any required videos and do any required readings *in advance* of the
relevant class meeting.
