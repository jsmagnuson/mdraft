#### Student responsibilities
- Register for credit or to audit (with permission).
- Participate in class -- ask questions, contribute to discussions.
- Strive to attend every class. Attendance is not explicitly graded, but when you are absent, you may miss quizzes and, and multiple absences may weaken your participation grade.
- Read assigned readings before the class where they will be discussed. As the semester progresses, try applying principles from the science of learning to your reading and studying.
- Be respectful of other participants in this course (fellow students and the instructor). Be mindful of contributing too much (be sure to allow others to contribute) or too little (it's a loss for the class if you don't share your thoughts and ideas!).

#### Ethics and academic integrity
**Plagiarism and misconduct.**
Plagiarism includes cases where you literally copy and paste someone else's work. However, it can also include paraphrasing without attribution (see next item), or even paraphrasing with attribution (when your text is highly similar to the original). There will be no tolerance for plagiarism or other forms of academic misconduct in this course. Evidence of misconduct will result in a student being dismissed from the course, which may entail a failing grade, depending on the time of semester. Please refer to the University of Connecticut Student Code on academic misconduct at:  http://www.community.uconn.edu/student_code_appendixa.html.

**Scholarship and attribution of sources.**
An aim of this course is to promote students' development as scholars. Scholarship entails drawing on the ideas and work of others. However, you must clearly cite sources (this is attribution) whenever you present the ideas or work of others. You must avoid even the impression that you are presenting someone else's ideas or work as your own. This is easily avoided by clear attribution through citation.

#### Respect and opportunities to contribute
We all share the responsibility of maintaining our classroom as a civil and respectful place of study, discussion, and work. Be mindful of how much you participate. It is great to be enthusiastic and engaged, but you shouldn't always be the first person to respond to a question or to contribute to a discussion. After you've made a contribution, try to let someone else make the next contribution. Let's not be afraid of silent pauses; some of us take more time to formulate a question or argument. We will all learn more if our seminar is a place where everyone has opportunities to contribute.
