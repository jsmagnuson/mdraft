Access and accommodations
=======================

Everyone should have equal access to the instructor, class resources, and fellow students. Everyone should have equal opportunity to participate and contribute. If you have any concerns about being able to participate, please talk to the instructor. Concerns might include requests for accommodations, even if you don't have a formal request from the Center for Students with Disabilities, or just an opportunity to discuss challenges you find as the class progresses. Really feel free to come to office hours or make an appointment to discuss any concerns.
