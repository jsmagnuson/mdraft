# Welcome

Welcome to {{ COURSE_CODE }}, {{ TITLE }}!

This is a brand new course. Let me explain why I've put in the effort to develop it.

Academically, my passion is research. In research, my passion is using computational models to develop theories of human cognition and perception, with particular focus on language. I have the incredible privilege of spending most of my working hours tinkering with models and trying to use them to understand how human language processing works.

My goal with this course is to share my fascination for computational tools with you. What you will learn in this course is directly applicable to modelling cognitive processes, and fairly easy to extend to related areas such as neuroscience or sociology. More importantly, I hope to share with you a way of thinking about problems that I call *computational thinking.* (It has come to my attention that there are some related ideas already associated with this label, but I am going to hang on to it for now.) This perspective focuses on developing causal explanations and testing them via simulation (or sometimes just calculation). It emphasizes the potential for complexity to *emerge* from interactions among simple (and/or complex) elements. We will explore some salient examples where seemingly mysterious and complex phenomena can be explained in surprisingly simple, transparent ways.
