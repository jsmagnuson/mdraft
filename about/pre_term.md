# Welcome

Welcome to {{ COURSE_CODE }}, {{ TITLE }}!

This is a brand new course. Let me explain why I've put in the effort to develop it.

Academically, my passion is research. In research, my passion is using computational models to develop theories of human cognition and perception, with particular focus on language. I have the incredible privilege of spending most of my working hours tinkering with models and trying to use them to understand how human language processing works.

My goal with this course is to share my fascination for computational tools with you. What you will learn in this course is directly applicable to modelling cognitive processes, and fairly easy to extend to related areas such as neuroscience or sociology. More importantly, I hope to share with you a way of thinking about problems that I call *computational thinking.* (It has come to my attention that there are some related ideas already associated with this label, but I am going to hang on to it for now.) This perspective focuses on developing causal explanations and testing them via simulation (or sometimes just calculation). It emphasizes the potential for complexity to *emerge* from interactions among simple (and/or complex) elements. We will explore some salient examples where seemingly mysterious and complex phenomena can be explained in surprisingly simple, transparent ways.


## Frequently asked/anticipated questions

```{dropdown} How do I address professors?

The short answer is: by default, use `Dr.` + `<last name>` or `Professor` + `<last name>` unless a professor invites you to address them otherwise (as I will do).

```{dropdown} Do I need to buy anything for this course?
    :class-container: sd-shadow-lg
    :color: primary

No, you do not need to purchase anything for this course. You will need access to a computer, and ideally, you will bring a computer with you to class. If you do not have a computer, please email me or come see me and I may be able to lend you a computer during class time. I will also try to make sure that the notebooks I create are compatible with the free google colaboratory (https://colab.research.google.com/), so you can work through the exercises from any computer connected to the internet.

```{dropdown} Will lectures be recorded so I can re-watch them to study?
    :class-container: sd-shadow-lg
    :color: primary

For about half the classes, lectures will be pre-recorded and available on this website. I might record class sessions, but I cannot promise that yet.

```

```{dropdown} Is attendance mandatory?
    :class-container: sd-shadow-lg
    :color: primary

- Attendance is **highly recommended**, but not required.
- That said, part of your grade is based on in-class participation; if you miss more than a couple of classes, that part of your grade will certainly decline
